brief: |
    My yet-to-be-titled platform game for the original Nintendo Game Boy,
    written in the Z80-esque assembly language native to the Game Boy CPU. A
    nostalgic project that has compounded my admiration for the creators of the
    games I used to play from the back seat of my parents' Škoda, the faint
    reflective LCD only sporadically illuminated by the street lights gliding
    by outside. I love that the limited instruction set of the Sharp LR35902
    makes every little paragraph of assembly code a small puzzle to solve.
